# Fake-Job-prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

Developed a classifier to distinguish between real and fake jobs using machine learning algorithms like KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision trees etc.
Used data collected from Kaggle and web scrapped from Indeed.com for analysis
Used Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag-of-Words (BoW) for analysis and model development
